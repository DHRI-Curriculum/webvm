Congrats, you are in the right track!

Now are a couple things you need to do to advance!
	- There's a kitty somewhere who is feeling lonely.
	- There's a monster scaring everyone. 
Explore the bed and see if you can fix these things.

When both are fixed, and only then, check the contents of done.txt and done2.txt
