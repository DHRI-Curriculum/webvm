**Congratulations!**

Getting here you practiced all the skills we have learned in the Command Line Workshop so far and you found the final treasure, which is four useful resources you practiced while hunting:

1. Removing files and directories. You learned the command `rm`, which removes a file or folder. Use it wisely!

2.  The wildcard `*`. Adding this symbol you can find all files with names in a specific pattern, such as in `d*` or `*.txt`.

3. Finding hidden files and directories. The option `-a` helped us to list all the hidden elements when using the command `ls -a`.

4. The absolute path. We learn that we can use `cd ../foldername`  instead of `cd ..` to get to a different directory. This is called the absolute path and it is used when we give the computer all the necessary details to get to the location of a file or folder. We invite you to search 'What is an absolute path?' on your browser and find out more about it! 


Consider adding these new elements to your cheat sheet :)
