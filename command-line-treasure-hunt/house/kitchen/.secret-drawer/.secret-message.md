**Congratulations!** You found the second and final treasure!

The treasure from this hunt is three useful resources for the command line you have learned to get here:
**1. Removing files and directories** You learned the command `rm`, which removes a file or folder. Use it wisely!
**2. The wildcard `*`**. Adding this symbol you can find all files with names in a specific pattern, such as in `d*` or `*.txt`.
**3. Finding hidden files and directories**. The option `-a` helped us to list all the hidden elements when using the command `ls -a`.

Getting here you practiced all the skills we have learned in the Command Line Workshop so far :)
