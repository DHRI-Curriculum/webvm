Great job!
I know you expected this to be the treasure, but I promise you are almost there.

The treasure is hidden as a hidden file, somewhere in the house. Hidden files start with a dot. Like this ".bash-config"
By default, they do not show up when you use `ls`. However, there is a way to make `ls` list hidden files and directories with the option `-a`. In this case, the command should be:

```console
$ ls -a
```

Now, I suggest you go back all the way to the `command-line-treasure-hunt` to start looking for it.

You can use `cd ..` multiple times until you get there. Or, if you're feeling fancy, you can use the absolute path and just go there directly.
Your choice!
