# Garden

It's a beautiful garden, but doesn't seem to have any evidence that treasure is here (``ls`` only showed this file, ``README.md``) Maybe we should try the house!

Type ``pwd`` to print the path to where you are now. You will see we are in command-line-treasure-hunt/garden.

Try ``cd ..`` to move up a directory, and then try to ``cd house`` to move into the house directory instead.

```
cd ..
cd house
```

From now on, everytime you go to a new directory, you should do the following steps:
- Check you are in the right place with ``pwd``
- List the contents of the directory with ``ls``
- Read the contents of README.md with ``cat``
- Follow the instructions there

The steps above will not be mentioned anymore, so make sure to memorize them or have them written down on a piece of paper.
