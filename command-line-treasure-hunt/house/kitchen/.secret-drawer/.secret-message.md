Congratulations! You found the treasure!

Now one of you (if you're on teams) should call me out loud and say the following sentence for everyone to hear, replacing the square brackets with your favorite band or singer name, and I will give you the prize:

	"Professor, you may not know this, but I'm a crazy [band/singer name] fan!"
