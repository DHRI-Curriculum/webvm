The number you just got will be the password for you to find the treasure. Go to the messy-room directory. You will see a maze of directories and subdirectories there. The path to the treasure will be through directories whose names ends with the numbers you just got.

Let's pretend the code was 12345. In that case, all you have to do is to find the directory whose names ends with 12345. It would be something like "J7864Z7235A4B23X12345"

Use your recently-acquired knowledge to move to the right directory. Remember wild cards?

If you find more directories there, try to find the one that ends with the code and move to it. Keep doing this until you find the subdirectory with the treasure on it.
