# It's a kitty!

You found a KITTY.md in the bed/ directory! How soft and cuddly. Congratulations!

But it looks lonely. Why don't you make it a DOGGIE.md here in bed/?
	1. Use the ``touch`` command to create a new, empty file.
		```
		touch DOGGIE.md
		```

	2. Use the VSCode text editor to edit the file.
		```
		code DOGGIE.md
		```

	3. In the DOGGIE.md file, write the following sentence in the first line of the document:
		"There is a doggie in the bed!"

		Attention: type the sentence above EXACTLY as is, but without the quotes. Don't add anything else to the file.

	4. Save the changes in the file.

	5. Exit VSCode and go back to the terminal.

If ``code DOGGIE.md`` is returning an error message, don't fret. This is just means that the settings that allow you to run VSCode from the terminal are not on. This is actually not too hard to do. Why don't you go to your browser and google "run vscode from terminal mac" and try to find and follow the instructions.

If it doesn't work or you don't want to work on that issue right now, you can just open VSCode normally, find the DOGGIE.md file from it, add the content and save it. Ask help if you are struggling with this.
