# Front room

A cozy front room, but no treasure. The tracks head into the kitchen. Let's go up to the house/ directory and into the kitchen/ instead!

In the file system, "up" or the parent folder is represented by two dots: ``..``
To move up to the parent of your current folder, you can use ``cd ..``
Make sure to write that down in your notes as well.

```
cd ..
cd kitchen
```
